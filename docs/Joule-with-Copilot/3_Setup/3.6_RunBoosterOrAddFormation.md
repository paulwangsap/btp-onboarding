# Run Booster / Add Formation

Add a system of type **Microsoft 365 Copilot for SAP Joule** to your system landscape and add this system to your Joule formation.

* If you are setting up a tenant for the first time, use the Joule booster. For more information, see Run the Joule Booster in the Joule Documentation, see [Run the Joule Booster in the Joule Documentation](http://help.sap.com/docs/JOULE/6189c8655c484916bb8eb767126a653a/34157c476600476cb9180062db6002af.html?version=CLOUD "Run the Joule Booster in the Joule Documentation").
* As a prerequisite that you should have at least one system integration with Joule like S/4HANA, SuccessFactors, etc. Since you have already done this setup, all you need to do is include the Microsoft 365 Copilot to the existing Joule formation.
