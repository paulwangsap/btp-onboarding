# Run Booster / Add Formation

Add a system of type **Microsoft 365 Copilot for SAP Joule** to your system landscape and add this system to your Joule formation.

* If you have already onboarded your tenant with the booster and you are using the same tenant for Teams integration, add a system of type **Microsoft365 Copilot for SAP Joule** to the existing formation.

* If you are setting up a tenant for the first time, use the Joule booster.
