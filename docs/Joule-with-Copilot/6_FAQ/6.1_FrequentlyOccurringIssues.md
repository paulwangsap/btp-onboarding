Reason: The issue arises when the Miscrosoft Entra and IAS setup is not configured correctly.

Fix: You need to configure IAS and Entra to trust each other and the conditional authentication in IAS is setup correctly for Joule. This is all explained in the Task - Configure Microsoft Entra ID as Identity Provider for Joule.

To facilitate your diagnose process, follow below steps:

* Wrong conditional authentication in IAS: Ensure the correct email domains of users are configured. Refer to the screenshot below.

* User is not added in the IAS tenant: Make sure the user accessing Microsoft Teams is added to the IAS tenant and their email is verified.
* Subject Name Identifier: Ensure the Subject Name Identifier for email is enabled/set in IAS.
* Microsoft Entra configuration: Verify that the configuration in Microsoft Entra is correct, as misconfiguration can cause the first token exchange (OBO token) to fail.

</p>

Reason: There is MS tenantID entry already exists in the DB maybe it was added previously by creating a formation and hence a unique constraint error.

Fix: Try to exclude the Microsoft 365 system from the formation and include the same again, this will help removing the existing entry in DB, which will help to resolve the issue.

You should be able to remove the misconfigured system from the Systems tab by clicking the row in the table and clicking the Remove button if you want to remove it from the Global Account.

## 7. Error - SAP Joule does not seem to be set up for your tenant. Please contact your administrator to check the prerequisites and set up the integration.

Fix: Check if system of type **Microsoft365 Copilot for SAP Joule** still exists in the formation and is not unassigned for this tenant. Also, the issue can be resolved by unassigning and assigning the system type which should then create APIM mappings.

Try to exclude the Microsoft 365 system from the formation and include the same again, this will help removing the existing entry in DB, which will help to resolve the issue.
