By integrating **Joule** and Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can leverage the Joule capabilities from within Microsoft 365 Copilot Business Chat. **Joule** is made available as a [Custom Engine Agent within Microsoft 365 Copilot![Information published on non-SAP site](https://help.sap.com/doc/3fdd7b321eb24d1b9d40605dce822e84/CLOUD/en-US/themes/sap-light/img/3rd_link.png "Information published on non-SAP site")](https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fappsource.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Foffice%2Fwa200008645 "https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/wa200008645"), and can be reached either via @-mentioning or selecting the Joule agent directly.

In general, all queries that **Joule** can answer via the **Joule** Web Client are also available through Microsoft 365 Copilot. The responses from **Joule** are re-formatted for display within the Microsoft 365 Copilot chat. Due to the need for this transformation, there are certain content types that cannot be visualized in Microsoft 365 Copilot. In such cases, the user will receive a message indicating that the content should be accessed through the **Joule** Web Client instead.
